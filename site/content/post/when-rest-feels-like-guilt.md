We don’t just fear falling behind — we fear being still.  
We’ve learned to measure our worth in motion,  
in calendars, metrics, and the noise of progress.

But the part inside you that wants to be reckless doesn’t care about the checklist.  
It wants quiet.  
It wants to breathe without earning it.

You tell yourself rest is recovery.  
But sometimes, it’s rebellion.  
Because the world doesn’t applaud you for stopping —  
and yet, maybe that’s exactly when you start returning to yourself.

Ask yourself —  
when was the last time you truly rested,  
not because you finished something,  
but because you finally let go of needing to?
