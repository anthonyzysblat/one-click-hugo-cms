We love being right.  
We love the comfort of clear answers, of things making sense.  
But certainty, like comfort, can become a cage.

The part inside you that wants to be reckless doesn’t crave chaos — it craves freedom.  
It knows that every belief you hold too tightly starts holding you back.  
That curiosity dies the moment you stop being willing to be wrong.

We tell ourselves that doubt is weakness.  
But doubt is where change begins.  
It’s where real growth happens — when we admit that what we know might not be enough.

The truth is, being certain costs you something:  
it costs you the possibility that life could be more than you’ve already decided it is.

So, ask yourself —  
what’s the last thing you were brave enough *not* to be sure about?
