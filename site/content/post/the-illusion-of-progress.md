We love momentum.  
The feeling that we’re advancing, achieving, becoming more.  
But what if all that movement is only another way of standing still?

The part inside you that wants to be reckless doesn’t care about appearances — it cares about truth.  
It asks, “Are you really growing, or just staying busy enough not to notice you’re lost?”

Progress isn’t the same as change.  
Sometimes it’s just repetition dressed in confidence.  
You get the job, you set the goal, you tick the box — and yet, something inside still whispers, *this isn’t it.*

Maybe the bravest progress is the kind that looks like stillness.  
Not rushing.  
Not escaping.  
Just facing what’s been chasing you all along.
