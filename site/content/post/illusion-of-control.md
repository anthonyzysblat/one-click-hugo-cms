We build plans so that nothing can surprise us.  
We create rules, systems, and routines — not for growth, but for safety.  
We call it control. It feels responsible. Mature. Smart.  

But control is often a disguise.  
It keeps life contained, predictable, sterile.  
It keeps us from the one thing that might actually change us: uncertainty.  

The part inside you that wants to be reckless doesn’t need to destroy control.  
It just wants to remind you that control isn’t real.  
That every choice you make depends on variables you’ll never see.  

You can’t plan your way into freedom.  
You can only step into it — uncertain, unguarded, awake.  

The question is whether you trust yourself enough to let go of what was never really holding you.
