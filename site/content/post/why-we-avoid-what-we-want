We love to believe that we’re patient.  
That we’re strategic.  
That we’re simply “waiting for the right time.”

But if you zoom out on your own life, you’ll notice something uncomfortable:

**The things you say you want the most are the very things you delay the longest.**

Starting the project.  
Ending the habit.  
Committing to the relationship.  
Leaving the relationship.  
Taking the risk.  
Changing your life.

You don’t reject these things.  
You postpone them — endlessly, skillfully, convincingly.

And you always have a reason.  
Always a justification.  
Always a story you can point to that makes your hesitation look intelligent rather than fearful.

We don’t avoid our desires.  
We avoid the *versions of ourselves* required to reach them.

## **Avoidance Disguised as Logic**

When you avoid something you actually want, you rarely say:

> “I’m scared.”

You say:

> “It’s not the right time.”  
> “I need to figure a few things out first.”  
> “I’m not ready yet.”  
> “Life is too busy right now.”  
> “Maybe next month.”

These reasons sound mature.  
They sound responsible.  
They even sound wise.

But look closer — they are almost always vague, flexible, and endlessly renewable.

If something is truly “not the right time,” you can name the moment when it *will* be the right time.

Most people can’t.  
Because they aren’t waiting for timing.

They’re waiting for courage.

## **Why We Avoid What We Want**

It’s not laziness.  
It’s not lack of desire.  
It’s not poor discipline.

It’s threat.

What you want threatens your current identity.

Here’s why:

### **1. Getting what you want requires becoming someone you’re not yet**

To achieve the thing you desire — the book, the business, the relationship, the change — you must evolve.

That evolution is uncomfortable because it exposes your limits:

- What if you try and fail?  
- What if you try and succeed, and then must maintain it?  
- What if people see who you really are?  
- What if people expect more of you?  
- What if *you* expect more of yourself?

The part inside you that wants to be reckless says:  
“Go. Move. Start.”

But the part of you built for survival whispers:  
“Stay who you are. It’s safer.”

### **2. Success is more frightening than failure**

Failure confirms your current identity.  
Success shatters it.

If you succeed:

- You’ll have to show up differently.  
- You’ll be seen differently.  
- You’ll need new habits.  
- You’ll step into new responsibility.  
- You’ll lose the excuse of “I could, but…”  

For many people, success threatens their emotional equilibrium more than failure does.

### **3. Wanting something deeply makes you vulnerable**

When you pursue what you don’t care about, you stay emotionally protected.

When you pursue what you *truly desire*, suddenly everything is at stake.

You can no longer pretend you didn’t care.  
You can no longer shrug off disappointment.  
You can no longer say “It’s whatever.”

Risking what matters is terrifying — so we avoid it and call the avoidance strategy.

## **The Seduction of “Not Yet”**

“Not yet” is one of the most seductive illusions in adult life.

Because *technically*, it isn’t a no.

It’s a maybe.  
It’s a someday.  
It’s a gentle, polite postponement that feels productive.

“Not yet” lets you feel in control.  
It lets you feel responsible.  
It lets you feel like you’re preparing when you’re really procrastinating.

And the mind LOVES “not yet” because:

- There is no deadline.  
- There is no accountability.  
- There is no exposure.  
- There is no vulnerability.  
- There is no risk.

“Not yet” is the perfect hiding place.

The part inside you that wants to be reckless sees right through it —  
it knows that *not yet* is just *never* wearing better clothes.

---

## **The Myth of Being Ready**

People say they’re waiting to feel “ready.”

But readiness is not a feeling — it’s a result.

You feel ready *after* you act, not before.

Ask anyone who has ever:

- started a business  
- fallen in love  
- had a child  
- moved countries  
- changed careers  
- reinvented themselves  

None of them felt “ready.”

They acted anyway.

Readiness is something you discover on the other side of action.

Avoidance is what you feel before it.

## **Why We Pretend It’s About Timing**

If we admitted we were scared, we’d have to confront the fear.  
But when we blame timing?

We feel justified, intelligent, balanced.

Timing is the easiest, most socially acceptable excuse for fear.

### **Timing lets you stay safe without feeling small.**  

You can tell the world you’re being deliberate, thoughtful, intentional —  
even though you’re simply protecting your nervous system from the shock of change.

Human beings are masters of psychological camouflage.

We convince others, but more importantly, we convince ourselves.

Because believing the lie is far more comfortable than confronting the truth:

We’re not waiting for a better time.  
We’re waiting for a braver version of ourselves.

---

## **The Reckless Mind’s Perspective**

The part inside you that wants to be reckless has a very different view.

It sees your hesitation for what it really is:

- Not timing.  
- Not logic.  
- Not strategy.  
- Not preparation.  

But **fear** dressed up in adult language.

It’s not judging you.  
It’s inviting you.

Inviting you to step into the life you keep imagining but never choosing.

Inviting you to stop postponing the version of yourself that already exists inside you —  
the one waiting, patiently, behind all your “not yet” excuses.

---

## **What Happens When You Finally Start?**

Something peculiar happens when people finally do the thing they’ve been avoiding:

It wasn’t as impossible as they imagined.  
It wasn’t as chaotic as they feared.  
It wasn’t as overwhelming as they predicted.

Instead, it feels like oxygen.

Because the greatest source of exhaustion wasn’t the effort of starting —  
it was the effort of avoiding.

Avoidance drains you.  
Action frees you.

And every tiny step you take dissolves the illusion of unreadiness.

You don’t become courageous first and then act.  
You act first — and courage follows.

---

## **So How Do You Stop Avoiding What You Want?**

Not with discipline.  
Not with motivation.  
Not with routines.

With honesty.

Ask yourself:

**What am I really afraid will happen if I succeed?**  
**What changes in my identity am I resisting?**  
**What responsibility am I avoiding?**  
**What version of me will I no longer be allowed to hide behind?**

These questions break the spell of “timing.”

Because the moment you understand what you’re actually afraid of,  
you’re no longer controlled by the excuse of “not yet.”

---

## **A Small Reckless Step**

You don’t need to leap.  
You don’t need to reinvent your life overnight.

Start with one tiny, uncomfortably honest action:

- Send the message.  
- Write the first line.  
- Apply for the thing.  
- Sign up.  
- Commit publicly.  
- Choose something that scares you just enough.  

Because action — even microscopic action — breaks the psychological trance of avoidance.

And once the trance breaks?  
Momentum begins.

---

## **The Truth You Already Know**

Your life is not waiting for better timing.  
It’s waiting for movement.

Nothing changes until you do.  
Nothing begins until you begin.  
Nothing becomes real until you take a step.

You don’t need a perfect plan.  
You don’t need the stars to align.  
You don’t need clarity.

You need honesty.  
You need willingness.  
You need one small moment of recklessness.

Because the future you want won’t arrive when the timing is right —  
it will arrive when *you* are willing to act despite the timing.

The part inside you that wants to be reckless already knows:

You’re not avoiding the goal.  
You’re avoiding the person you’ll have to become to reach it.

And that person?  
That person is already inside you, waiting for their turn to live.
