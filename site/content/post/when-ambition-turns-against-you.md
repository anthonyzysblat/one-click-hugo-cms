Ambition begins as a spark.  
It’s the part of you that wants to grow, to matter, to leave something behind.  
But sometimes that same spark starts burning through the wrong things — peace, patience, even joy.

The part inside you that wants to be reckless doesn’t want more — it wants *real*.  
It wants meaning, not motion.  
It doesn’t confuse being busy with being alive.

We’ve all learned to praise ambition, to see it as fuel.  
But fuel burns, and if you’re not careful, it burns you too.  

Ask yourself —  
are you chasing what you love,  
or have you just forgotten how to stop running?

Maybe it’s not ambition that needs direction.  
Maybe it’s you that needs to remember why you started moving at all.
