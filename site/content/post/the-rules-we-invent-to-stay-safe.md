You’ve built your life around invisible rules.  
Don’t speak too soon. Don’t ask too much. Don’t fail. Don’t fall.  
You call it discipline, responsibility, being grown up.  
But really, most of it started as fear — and then hardened into truth.

The part inside you that wants to be reckless still remembers when those rules were written.  
They weren’t laws. They were choices you made to survive.  
And you’ve kept them so long, you started to mistake them for who you are.

But safety is strange.  
It keeps you from pain, but it also keeps you from discovery.  
It builds a life that looks stable, but not alive.

Ask yourself —  
which of your rules still serve you,  
and which ones just keep you still?

Because until you start breaking the ones that no longer fit,  
you’ll never know what freedom was trying to give you all along.
