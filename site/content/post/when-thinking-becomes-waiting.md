We call it patience. We call it reflection. But sometimes thinking is only another way to hide.

The careful mind wants proof before it moves. The part inside you that wants to be reckless only needs a pulse — a small sign that life is still yours to steer. One calls it planning. The other calls it living.

Every time you wait for the right moment, you train yourself to believe that life has appointments you must keep. But moments aren’t scheduled; they appear, and then they’re gone.

What if waiting has become your quietest form of surrender?  
What if the thing you’re preparing for will never come until you stop preparing?

Thinking isn’t wrong. It just has limits. At some point, thought must become motion.  
Otherwise, all you’re mastering is the art of postponement.
