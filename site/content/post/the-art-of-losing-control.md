We spend our lives trying to hold things together.  
To stay composed. To stay in charge.  
But the harder you grip, the less you feel.

The part inside you that wants to be reckless knows this.  
It doesn’t crave chaos — it craves release.  
It knows that control isn’t strength. It’s fear, disguised as order.

You tell yourself you’re being responsible.  
That letting go is dangerous.  
But maybe what’s dangerous is never letting yourself feel alive.

Because the truth is, you were never meant to hold everything.  
You were meant to move with it.  
To be undone. To start again.  
And to realize that sometimes, the only way to stay in control  
is to stop pretending you ever were.
