You spend years chasing happiness —  
then when it arrives, you flinch.

The part inside you that wants to be reckless loves happiness,  
but it doesn’t trust it.  
Because happiness means being open.  
And openness means risk.  
If you let yourself feel good, you might lose it.  
If you let yourself care, it might end.

So you lower your joy just enough to feel safe.  
You tell yourself you’re being realistic,  
when really, you’re just rehearsing loss in advance.

But what if happiness isn’t something you hold?  
What if it’s something you enter —  
knowing it will leave, and choosing it anyway?

The reckless part of you understands this better than the careful one ever will.  
It knows that joy is never owned — only lived.  
And maybe that’s enough.
