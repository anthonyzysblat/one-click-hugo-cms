# The part inside you that wants to be reckless is still alive.

We all have two minds.

The cautious one — built from expectation, responsibility, and the need to keep things together.

And the reckless one — the part inside you that sees clearly, wants deeply, and refuses to pretend.

This is a space for people who have hidden that part of themselves for too long.  
A space to understand why we live the way we do — and what happens when we finally stop.
